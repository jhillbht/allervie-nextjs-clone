# Allervie Dashboard Deployment Summary

## Current Status

We attempted to deploy the Allervie Dashboard to DigitalOcean App Platform and encountered some issues. Here's a summary of the current state:

### Deployment Status

- **App Name**: allervie-analytics-dashboard
- **App URL**: https://allervie-analytics-dashboard-v9w2f.ondigitalocean.app
- **App ID**: 2ec0029a-7736-41ce-bb63-d7c3e8642c7c
- **Active Deployment ID**: 7c254ac9-12ed-4638-8cde-1d31bac89814
- **Latest Deployment ID**: b8383f14-8b2c-47f8-9438-2d02957af069 (Failed)
- **Latest Deployment Status**: ERROR (1/6 steps completed, 1 error)

### Issues Identified

1. **Build Error**: The latest deployment failed during the build phase.
2. **API Routes Not Working**: The `/api/health` endpoint returns a 404 error.
3. **Dashboard Redirection Issue**: The `/dashboard` route is returning a 308 redirect loop.

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. Verified local build works correctly.
2. Deployed using the deployment script (`deploy-digitalocean.sh`).
3. Monitored deployment status using `doctl apps get-deployment`.
4. Checked application health at various endpoints.
5. Attempted to view detailed logs to diagnose issues.

## Analysis

The deployment issues appear to be related to one or more of the following:

1. **GitHub Repository Configuration**: The GitHub repository specified in the `.do/app.yaml` file (`jhillbht/allervie-nextjs-clone`) might not have the correct branch or commit access.

2. **Build Process**: The build process may be failing due to compatibility issues with Next.js 15.2.2 and Node 22.x in the DigitalOcean App Platform environment.

3. **Route Configuration**: The API routes might not be properly configured in the deployed application.

4. **Environment Variables**: There might be missing or incorrect environment variables affecting the application's functionality.

## Recommendations

Based on our findings, here are the recommended next steps:

1. **Check GitHub Repository**:
   - Verify that the GitHub repository specified in `.do/app.yaml` exists and is accessible.
   - Ensure that the DigitalOcean App Platform has proper access to the repository.

2. **Update Run Command**:
   - Modify the run command in `.do/app.yaml` to use `node .next/standalone/server.js` instead of `npm start` to align with Next.js standalone output recommendations.

3. **Simplify Build Process**:
   - Consider simplifying the build process to reduce potential points of failure.
   - Remove any unnecessary steps or dependencies from the build process.

4. **Check API Routes Implementation**:
   - Verify that the API routes are properly implemented and exported.
   - Check for any configuration issues in the Next.js API routes.

5. **View Detailed Logs in the DigitalOcean Console**:
   - The command-line tools have limitations in showing detailed error logs.
   - Log into the DigitalOcean console to view the full build logs for the failed deployment.

## Next Steps

1. Update the `.do/app.yaml` file with the corrected run command:
   ```yaml
   run_command: node .next/standalone/server.js
   ```

2. Commit and push these changes to the repository.

3. Re-deploy using the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-digitalocean.sh
   ```

4. Monitor the deployment using the DigitalOcean console for more detailed logs.

5. If issues persist, consider creating a simplified version of the dashboard with fewer features to isolate the problematic components.

## Conclusion

While the current deployment attempt was not successful, we've identified several potential issues and provided recommendations for resolving them. By following the recommended steps, we can work toward a successful deployment of the Allervie Dashboard on DigitalOcean App Platform.
